Use FB Favorites to follow the posts that most interest you!
 
 Our chrome extension is available at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-favorites/jkmicdclmjfomkkclpmegimopgadoigg
  
  This extension allows the user to keep track of their favorite parts of Facebook's newsfeed.
  It is completely integrated to Facebook's website!
   
   FB favorites is composed of a chrome extension and a web server.
    
    The extension is written in javascript and modifies the content displayed when you browse facebook. It searches occurrences of posts on the news feed, and add a favorite button. You can favorite or unfavorite a post by clicking the mentioned button, and you can see all favorite posts on the button Favorites on the left board.
     
     The web server runs on Google APP Engine. It stores all posts marked favorite as well as the user who marked them.
     Our API permits the client side to insert, delete and check if a post is on the database, and also get all posts inserted by some user id.
